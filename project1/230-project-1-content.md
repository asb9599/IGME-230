## Care for a Stroll?
Have you ever taken a walk through the woods at night? It's quite the experience. With the cool night air and the moonlight shining through the trees, it can be absolutely breathtaking. However, some might find the experience slightly unnerving. Afterall, you never know what's ahead in the dark, and that feeling of unease can seem overwhelming at times. To illustrate this, I have created a game where you will simply walk from left to right across a scrolling forest at night. I cannot tell you what exactly you will find on this walk, but if you are like me and enjoy a good atmosphere shrouded in the unknown, I encourage you to give it a try. So how about it, are you feeling up for a midnight stroll?
## About the Author
My name is Andrew Brook, and I am a sophomore studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology. I specialize in game design, but I have taught myself a lot of development skills over the last few years and I am interested in making immersive (and fun) interactive experiences. I work mostly in the Unity game engine, but I have extensive experience in GameMaker Studio, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and the MonoGame C# framework.

# Proposal Page
## I. Concept
This game is like Inside or Limbo, only with crisp pixel art and a much heavier focus on environment and psychological simulation. You walk through a spooky woods at night, and some things you can't explain happen. What things you ask? Well, that's part of the adventure!
## II. Genre
The game is an exploration-based platformer, with a little bit of horror. However, unlike a lot of horror games, the game's intent is not to scare you, but more to make you feel a sense of unease.
## III. Story
The story of the game is simple: you're walking through a spooky forest that you have no recollection of entering, and no sense of direction or even time as you walk through it. The only thing you know is that there's snow on the ground and the moon is full and vibrant tonight, and it seems like a good time for a stroll.
## IV. Aesthetics
The game relies on sprite-based animations and pixel art, with a dark and limited color palette.
## V. Gameplay
The gameplay is simply walking from the left to the right through a parallax forest, and you can expect the following controls:
1. Use the left and right arrow keys (or the analog stick if using an Xbox controller) to move left and right
2. Press the 'X' key (or "B" button if using an Xbox Controller) to interact, which you might have to do on occasion
As you continue through the game, things will change, and you should expect a randomized set of events and open yourself to the unexpected
## Screenshots

## Inspiration
I came up with the idea of this game because ever since I was little, I've always liked taking walks through the woods at night. While initially I did it to confront my fear of the dark at the time, I soon learned to love that feeling of walking into the woods and not knowing what to expect. It was always a journey into the unknown for me, and somehow I always found enjoyment and comfort in that.I thought about it, and decided that it would be a fun idea to make a game where you just walk through a scrolling parallax forest. After thinking about it further, I came up with a few ways that I could make it a little more interesting and at some point it became a lot creepier and I just decided, hey, let me see how I can keep people on the edge of their seat.
## Assets
I had actually started working on a prototype for this idea during Fall of 2017 in the C# MonoGame framework, and I designed a few assets for it that I am certainly going to use on this game. I'm really proud of the character I animated for this game, and I hope that I can design a more fitting environment to really immerse people in the atmosphere.
## Developing the Site
Developing this web site was a little strenuous for me, given how at the time of making this, I was really ill and honestly did not have much energy to do much of anything. Despite this, I pressed on and focused on how I could really make the design of the site express the sort of mood I want to go for in the game. To do this, I first had to plan out the actual content of the site, which I would use to match the design I would create. Ultimately, I decided on a much more basic approach to the site, focusing on the actual text itself and a nice background image to give context. I also chose a dark color palette that I believed would really suit the sort of style I'm going for with all of this.
## Notes about this Assignment
My proposal was very cryptic compared to most, but that was entirely intentional. I want to really leave users in the dark as far as what to expect from this game, so I kept it really simple in terms of explanation: you walk left to right in the woods and some stuff happens.
