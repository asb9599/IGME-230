            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I came up with the idea of this game because ever since I was little, I've always liked taking walks through the woods at night. While initially I did it to confront my fear of the dark at the time, I soon learned to love that feeling of walking into the woods and not knowing what to expect. It was always a journey into the unknown for me, and somehow I always found enjoyment and comfort in that.I thought about it, and decided that it would be a fun idea to make a game where you just walk through a scrolling parallax forest. After thinking about it further, I came up with a few ways that I could make it a little more interesting and at some point it became a lot creepier and I just decided, hey, let me see how I can keep people on the edge of their seat.</p>
            <h2>Assets</h2>
            <p>I had actually started working on a prototype for this idea during Fall of 2017 in the C# MonoGame framework, and I designed a few assets for it that I am certainly going to use on this game. I'm really proud of the character I animated for this game, and I hope that I can design a more fitting environment to really immerse people in the atmosphere.</p>
            <h2>Developing the Site</h2>
            <p>Developing this web site was a little strenuous for me, given how at the time of making this, I was really ill and honestly did not have much energy to do much of anything. Despite this, I pressed on and focused on how I could really make the design of the site express the sort of mood I want to go for in the game. To do this, I first had to plan out the actual content of the site, which I would use to match the design I would create. Ultimately, I decided on a much more basic approach to the site, focusing on the actual text itself and a nice background image to give context. I also chose a dark color palette that I believed would really suit the sort of style I'm going for with all of this.</p>
            <h2>Notes about this Assignment</h2>
            <p>My proposal was very cryptic compared to most, but that was entirely intentional. I want to really leave users in the dark as far as what to expect from this game, so I kept it really simple in terms of explanation: you walk left to right in the woods and some stuff happens.</p>
            <h2>Sources</h2>
            <p>The only image that I did not make on this site was the background image, which I found on this page: <a href = "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=844946240">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=844946240</a></p>
            <p>I used the following fonts on this site:</p>
