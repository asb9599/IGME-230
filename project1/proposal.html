            <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
            <p>This game is like Inside or Limbo, only with crisp pixel art and a much heavier focus on environment and psychological simulation. You walk through a spooky woods at night, and some things you can't explain happen. What things you ask? Well, that's part of the adventure!</p>
            <h2>II. Genre</h2>
            <p>The game is an exploration-based platformer, with a little bit of horror. However, unlike a lot of horror games, the game's intent is not to scare you, but more to make you feel a sense of unease.</p>
            <h2>III. Story</h2>
            <p>The story of the game is simple: you're walking through a spooky forest that you have no recollection of entering, and no sense of direction or even time as you walk through it. The only thing you know is that there's snow on the ground and the moon is full and vibrant tonight, and it seems like a good time for a stroll.</p>
            <h2>IV. Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The game relies on sprite-based animations and pixel art, with a dark and limited color palette.</p>
            <h2>V. Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The gameplay is simply walking from the left to the right through a parallax forest, and you can expect the following controls:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the left and right arrow keys (or the analog stick if using an Xbox controller) to move left and right
                <li>Press the 'X' key (or "B" button if using an Xbox Controller) to interact, which you might have to do on occasion</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As you continue through the game, things will change, and you should expect a randomized set of events and open yourself to the unexpected</p>
